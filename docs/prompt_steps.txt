I'm building a web app using Next.js for reddit posts, what is the best package to use?
https://www.npmjs.com/package/snoowrap

@Snoowrap Help me build a simple typescript file of fetching reddit posts data from past 24 hours under 'ollama', including title, content, score, num comments, date using Snoowrap, and create the file

https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/structured-outputs/examples
help me write a simple typescript to categorise reddit posts, it should have output 'PostCategoryAnalysis', where it has boolean(true/false) value for each category below:
1. Solution requests: Posts where people are seeking solutions for problems.
2. Pain & anger: Posts where people are expressing pain or anger.
3. Advice requests: Posts where people are seeking advice.
4. Money talk: Posts where people are talking about spending money.

I want you to use the openai structured output instead, use the example above as reference to refactor the code.

Also, I want you to set the description of each category to the zod model PostCategoryAnalysisSchema itself instead of part of a prompt, so later it will be more flexible if categories change
