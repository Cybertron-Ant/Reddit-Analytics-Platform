# Supabase Integration Design Document

## Project Overview

The goal is to integrate Supabase as a backend for the Reddit Analytics Platform to:

- Save subreddit data fetched via the Reddit API to a Supabase database.
- Ensure efficient data fetching by only refetching subreddit data if the last update time is older than 24 hours.

This document provides a step-by-step structure for backend engineers, detailing the core components for Supabase integration, database schema design, and the workflows necessary to support this functionality.

## Project Structure for Backend Integration

### Components to Build for Supabase Integration

#### API for Data Fetching and Storage:
- A backend API endpoint to fetch subreddit data using Snoowrap.
- Save the fetched data to Supabase.
- Check the last updated timestamp to determine whether data needs to be refetched.

#### Supabase Integration Layer:
- A utility module to handle interaction with Supabase (read/write operations).

#### Cron Job or Scheduled Functionality:
- Automate periodic checks to determine if data needs to be refetched based on the last update time.

#### Error Handling and Logging:
- Robust error handling for database operations and API requests.
- Logging mechanisms for debugging and monitoring.

## Database Design

### Database Tables

The database should have the following tables:

#### 1. Subreddits Table

This table stores the basic metadata of subreddits being tracked.

| Column Name | Data Type | Description |
|------------|-----------|-------------|
| id | UUID | Primary key. |
| name | VARCHAR(255) | Name of the subreddit (e.g., openai). |
| url | VARCHAR(255) | Subreddit URL. |
| created_at | TIMESTAMP | Timestamp of when the entry was created. |
| updated_at | TIMESTAMP | Last time the data was updated. |

#### 2. Posts Table

This table stores the fetched posts from each subreddit.

| Column Name | Data Type | Description |
|------------|-----------|-------------|
| id | UUID | Primary key. |
| subreddit_id | UUID | Foreign key referencing Subreddits.id. |
| title | TEXT | Title of the post. |
| content | TEXT | Content of the post. |
| score | INTEGER | Score of the post. |
| num_comments | INTEGER | Number of comments. |
| url | VARCHAR(255) | URL of the post. |
| created_utc | TIMESTAMP | Post creation time (UTC). |
| fetched_at | TIMESTAMP | Timestamp of when the post was fetched. |

#### 3. Themes Table

This table stores categorized data analyzed by the OpenAI API.

| Column Name | Data Type | Description |
|------------|-----------|-------------|
| id | UUID | Primary key. |
| post_id | UUID | Foreign key referencing Posts.id. |
| category | VARCHAR(255) | Category of the post (e.g., Solution Request, Pain & Anger). |
| confidence_score | FLOAT | Confidence score of the categorization. |

## Workflow

### 1. Fetching Subreddit Data

**Trigger:**
- Manual trigger via UI or periodic scheduled task.

**Process:**
- Fetch subreddit metadata and posts from Reddit API using Snoowrap.
- Check updated_at in the Subreddits table.
- If older than 24 hours, update the data.
- If within 24 hours, skip refetching.
- Insert or update posts in the Posts table.

### 2. Storing Data in Supabase

Use a utility function to handle database operations:
- Insert new subreddits into the Subreddits table if they don't exist.
- Update updated_at when data is refreshed.
- Insert or update posts in the Posts table, ensuring no duplication.

### 3. Analyzing Posts

**Trigger:**
- After new posts are saved, send data to OpenAI for categorization.

**Process:**
- Use OpenAI API to analyze the content of each post.
- Store results in the Themes table with the category and confidence score.

### 4. Optimized Data Flow

- Pre-fetch Check: Ensure no unnecessary API calls by comparing updated_at.
- Batch Processing: Process posts in batches to optimize database and API usage.
- Concurrency: Enable concurrent API calls and database writes for better performance.

## Supabase Integration Code Example

Example function for checking updated_at and fetching data:

```javascript
async function updateSubredditData(subredditName) {
  const { data, error } = await supabase
    .from('Subreddits')
    .select('*')
    .eq('name', subredditName);

  if (error) throw new Error(error.message);

  const lastUpdated = new Date(data[0]?.updated_at);
  const now = new Date();
  const hoursSinceUpdate = (now - lastUpdated) / (1000 * 60 * 60);

  if (hoursSinceUpdate > 24) {
    // Fetch new data and update Supabase
  } else {
    console.log('Data is up-to-date. No fetch needed.');
  }
}
```

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Error Logging:
- Log database operation failures and API errors to track issues.

### Performance Monitoring:
- Monitor Supabase query performance and API response times.

### Scalability:
- Use Supabase's row-level security policies to ensure secure access to data.
- Optimize queries with indexes on frequently queried fields (e.g., updated_at, subreddit_id).
